# JavaScript Usage Rule

- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) features such as `let`, `const`, arrow functions, and template literals.
- Prefer functional programming patterns where possible.
- Avoid using `var`; use `let` or `const` instead.
- Use single quotes for strings, except when interpolation is needed (then use template literals).
- Always use semicolons at the end of statements.
- Organize code into modules using ES6 `import` and `export` syntax.
- Add JSDoc comments for all exported functions and classes.
- Prefer array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` over traditional loops when appropriate.
- Avoid using global variables; encapsulate logic within modules or functions.
